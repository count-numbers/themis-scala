# Themis Frontend

The frontend is based on angular-seed and is currently separated from the server. It could
go into src/main/webapp, but only the app folder of this needs to end up in the WAR.

This project is nowhere near ready and there is no use in cloning it at this time.

The project does not have a license yet.
